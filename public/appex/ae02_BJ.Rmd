## Configuring SSH and GitHub (instructions)

**Note: if you have already done this, you do NOT need to do this again**

### configure ssh

1. First, type `credentials::ssh_setup_github()` into your console.
2. Second, R will ask "No SSH key found. Generate one now?" You should click 1 for yes.
3. Third, you will generate a key. It will begin with "ssh-rsa...." R will then ask "Would you like to open a browser now?" You should click 1 for yes.
4. Fourth, you may be asked to provide your username and password to log into GitHub. This would be the ones associated with your account that you set up. After entering this information, you should paste the key in and give it a name.

### configure git

Configure git by running the following code in the **terminal**. Fill in your GitHub username and the email address associated with your GitHub account.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
git config --global user.name 'username'
git config --global user.email 'emailaddress'
```
*You should not have to do this every time.*

## Submitting application exercises
- Once you have completed the activity, push your final changes to your GitHub repo. Make sure you committed at least *three* times. Check that  your repo is updated on GitHub, and thatâ€™s all you need to do to submit application exercises for participation.
- `ae02` will *not* be graded.
