We want to look at the voting history of countries in the United Nations General 
Assembly using data from package `unvotes`. 

```{r set-up, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, 
                      echo = TRUE, 
                      message = FALSE)
```

```{r load-packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(unvotes)
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_bw())
library(lubridate)
library(DT)
library(scico)
```

## Data

We will work with three data sets: `un_roll_calls`, `un_roll_call_issues`, 
and `un_votes`. Each data set contains a variable called `rcid`, the roll call 
id, which can be used to join the data sets with one another.

- The `un_votes` data set provides information on the voting history of the 
  United Nations General Assembly. It contains one row for each country/vote 
  pair.

```{r view-un_votes}
un_votes
```

- The `un_roll_calls` data set contains information on each roll call vote of 
  the United Nations General Assembly.

```{r view-un_roll_calls}
un_roll_calls
```

- The `un_roll_call_issues` data set contains issue classifications of roll call 
votes of the United Nations General Assembly. 

```{r view-un_roll_call_issues}
un_roll_call_issues
```
There are many votes that have no issue classification, and some are classified 
under more than one issue.

```{r view-un_roll_call_issues_ex}
un_roll_call_issues %>% filter(rcid == 3)
un_roll_call_issues %>% filter(rcid == 6)
un_roll_call_issues %>% filter(rcid == 11)
```

## Analysis

### Part 1

We begin by looking at how often each country voted "yes" on a resolution in 
each year. We'll visualize the results focusing on permanent members of the 
UN Security Council.

```{r country-list}
country_list <- c("United States", "Russia", "United Kingdom", "France", "China")
```

```{r plot-yearly-yes, fig.width=10, warning=FALSE}
un_votes %>%
  filter(country %in% country_list) %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = "rcid") %>% 
  group_by(year = year(date), country) %>%
  summarize(percent_yes = mean(vote == "yes")) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = percent_yes, color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  ylab("% of votes that are 'Yes'") +
  scale_color_scico_d() 
```

### Part 2

Next, let's see how the voting records have changed over the years on each of the issues.

```{r plot-yearly-yes-issue, fig.width=10, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
un_votes %>%
  filter(country %in% country_list) %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = "rcid") %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_call_issues, by = "rcid") %>%
  group_by(country, year = year(date), issue) %>%
  summarize(votes = n(),
            percent_yes = mean(vote == "yes")) %>%
  filter(votes > 5) %>%  # Only use records where there are more than 5 votes
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = percent_yes, color = country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) + 
  ylab("% of votes that are 'Yes'") +
  facet_wrap(~ issue) +
  scale_color_scico_d() 
```

### Discussion Questions

1. Consider the plot from Part 1. Describe how the voting behaviors of the five 
countries have changed over time.

2. Consider the plot from Part 2. 
    - On which issues have the five countries (or majority of them) voted 
    most similarly in recent years? 
    - On which issues have they voted most differently in recent years? 
    - Are there groups of countries with similar voting behaviors? If so, on what issues? 
    - Has this changed over time?
