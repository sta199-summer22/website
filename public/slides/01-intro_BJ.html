# Data Science

---

## What is Data Science?

--

- Data science is using data to understand the world.

- We're going to learn to do this in a principled and `tidy` way -- more on that later!

- This is a course on introduction to data science, with an emphasis on statistical thinking.

---

## Course FAQ

**Q - What data science background does this course assume?**
A - None.

&lt;br&gt;

**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**
A - Not a traditional one. While statistics `\(\neq\)` data science, they are very closely related and have tremendous of overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics.

&lt;br&gt;

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**
A - Yes. We will use the computing language R.

---

## Course Learning Objectives

- Learn to explore, visualize, and analyze data in a *reproducible* and *shareable* manner

- Gain experience in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization

- Develop your own question(s) about data and use statistical techniques to answer the question(s)

- Practice effective oral and written communication of results 

---

## Some of What You Will Learn

.pull-left[
- Fundamentals of `R`

- Version control with `GitHub`

- Reproducible reports with `R Markdown`

- Data visualization and wrangling with `ggplot2` and `dplyr` from the `tidyverse`

&lt;!-- - Web based applications with `RShiny` --&gt;

]

.pull-right[
- Data types and functions

- Spatial data visualization

&lt;!-- - Regression and classification --&gt;

- Statistical inference
]

## Examples of Data Science in Practice

- [Russian Invasion of Ukraine](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-ukraine-russia-us-nato-conflict/)

- [What Redisctricting Looks Like in Every State](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/)

- [Tracking Sleep with Apple Watch](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-i-learned-by-tracking-my-sleep-with-apple-watch-bea2caa49a47)

- [Infectious Disease Tracker](https://nextstrain.org)

---

## Time for an Analysis!

- Let's look at the [UN vote analysis](https://sta199-summer22.netlify.app/appex/ae01_BJ.html).

## Create a GitHub Account

Go to https://github.com/, and create an account (unless you already have one). 

After you create your account, go to [https://forms.gle/WgBRjAoCJPb5eNBX7](https://forms.gle/WgBRjAoCJPb5eNBX7) and enter your name, Duke email address (NETID@duke.edu), and GitHub username. 

&lt;small&gt;
Some tips from [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice).
&lt;/small&gt;

- &lt;small&gt; Incorporate your actual name!&lt;/small&gt;
- &lt;small&gt; Reuse your username from other contexts if you can, e.&lt;small&gt; g., Twitter or Slack.&lt;/small&gt;
- &lt;small&gt; Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.&lt;/small&gt;
- &lt;small&gt; Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. Shorter is better than longer.&lt;/small&gt;
- &lt;small&gt; Make it timeless.&lt;/small&gt;
- &lt;small&gt; Avoid words with special meaning in programming (e.g. `NA`).&lt;/small&gt;
