# Goals

- Find your team and teammates for the final project. 
- Practice collaboration using the data science workflow.
- Learn how to identify and handle merge conflicts.

# Getting started

- Check the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W7IP9bBbZIAPSl0hw6FaekSFGu337vYfjaCBVOOobnM/edit?usp=sharing) to find your team number and members. 

## In person 

- Introduce yourself.
- Choose your team name and write down next to your team number in the spreadsheet. 
- Find a one hour block of time outside of class that you can use to work on the project if needed. You may not need to use this, but it is good to have it in reserve. Tools like [Doodle](https://doodle.com/en/) and [When2Meet](https://www.when2meet.com/) are helpful.
- Determine how your team will communicate (email, text, slack, etc).

## On GitHub

- Every team member should now go to the [course GitHub organization page](https://github.com/sta199-summer22) and locate your "project-teamname" repository.
Copy the URL of the repository and clone in RStudio. 
- You all will work in the same `proposal.Rmd` document and submit one pdf to gradescope.
- **Do not edit the `proposal.Rmd` file until explicitly asked to do so in the instructions.**

# Team workflow 

Assign each team member a number 1 through 3 (or 4) and write your number down 
on a piece of paper. This lab will walk you through the basics of team workflow 
step-by-step.

**Do the following exercises in order, following each step carefully.**

**Only one person at a time should type in the `proposal.Rmd` file and push updates.**

<span style="color: blue;">**Team member 1:**</span>

- Open the `proposal.Rmd` file and change "Your Names" in the author 
of the YAML with your first and last name. Keep "Team Name: " as is. 
- When you have finished, knit to PDF, then stage, commit, and push your `proposal.Rmd` 
and PDF to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

<span style="color: blue;">**All the other team members:**</span> 

- Once your team member has pushed the work, pull to get the updated documents 
from GitHub. Click on the `proposal.Rmd` file and you should see the team name and 
the first team member's name in the YAML. 

<span style="color: blue;">**Team member 2:**</span>

- It's your turn. Add your name in the YAML next to the first team member's name. 
- When you have finished, knit to PDF, then stage, commit, and push your `proposal.Rmd` 
and PDF to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

<span style="color: blue;">**All the other team members:**</span> 

- Once your team member has pushed the work, pull to get the updated documents 
from GitHub. Click on the `proposal.Rmd` file and you should see the team name and 
the first and last names of the first two team members in the YAML. 

<span style="color: blue;">**Team member 3:**</span>

- It's your turn. Add your name in the YAML. 
- When you have finished, knit to PDF, then stage, commit, and push your `proposal.Rmd` 
and PDF to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

<span style="color: blue;">**All the other team members:**</span>

- Once your team member has pushed the work, pull to get the updated documents 
from GitHub. Click on the `proposal.Rmd` file and you should see the team name and 
the first and last names of your team members in the YAML. 

<span style="color: blue;">**Team member 4:**</span>

- It's your turn. Add your name in the YAML. 
- When you have finished, knit to PDF, then stage, commit, and push your `proposal.Rmd` 
and PDF to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

<span style="color: blue;">**All the other team members:**</span>

- Once your team member has pushed the work, pull to get the updated documents 
from GitHub. Click on the `proposal.Rmd` file and you should see the team name and 
the first and last names of all team members in the YAML. 

# Merge conflicts (uh oh)

Before you begin, it's important to know about merge conflicts. 

![](img/merge-no-conflict.png)

Merge conflicts occur when two or more people are working on the same file at the same time.

When two collaborators make changes to the same file and push the file to their repository, git merges the two files.

![](img/merge-conflict.png)

If these two files have conflicting content on the same line, git will produce a
**merge conflict**. Merge conflicts need to be resolved manually, as they require a human 
intervention:

![](img/merge-conflict-identifiers.png)

To resolve the merge conflict, decide if you want to keep only your text, the 
text on GitHub, or incorporate changes from both texts. Delete the conflict 
markers `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` and make the changes you want in the 
final merge.

**Ultimately, the goal is to avoid merge conflicts. One way to do this is to ensure only one person is typing in the team's R Markdown document at any given time.**

See the [FAQ](https://sta199-summer22.netlify.app/faq/faq.html) with step-by-step instructions for troubleshooting a merge conflict.

## Resolving a merge conflict

Some times merge conflicts still happen. To prepare for this scenario, let's 
practice creating and resolving a merge conflict.

<span style="color: blue;">**Team Member 4**</span> should look at the team's 
repo on GitHub to ensure that the other members' files are pushed to GitHub after every
step.

<span style="color: blue;">**Step 1 (Team member 1):**</span> Change the team name 
to your team name and then knit, commit, and push. 

<span style="color: blue;">**Step 2 (Team member 2):**</span> Change the team name 
to something different (i.e., not your team name). Knit, commit, and push.

You should get an error.

**Pull** and review the document with the merge conflict. Read the error
to your teammates. A merge conflict occurred because you edited the same part of
the document as member 1. Resolve the conflict with whichever name you
want to keep, then knit, commit manually in "Terminal" in RStudio (see [FAQ](https://sta199-summer22.netlify.app/faq/faq.html)) and push again.

<span style="color: blue;">**Step 3 (Team member 3):**</span> Write some narrative in the space provided. You should get an error.

This time, no merge conflicts should occur, since you edited a different
part of the document from members 1 and 2. Read the error to your
teammates. 

Click to pull. Then, knit, commit, and push. All merge conflicts
should be resolved and all documents updated in the GitHub repo.

# Project proposal 

Click [here](https://sta199-summer22.netlify.app/project/project_BJ.html) 
for the final project. Read the instructions carefully and work 
on the project proposal in `project.Rmd`. 

# Submission

- You do not need to submit anything on Gradescope for team workflow and merge conflicts. 
- You do need to submit project proposal. Follow instructions in [project](https://sta199-summer22.netlify.app/project/project_BJ.html) for submission.
