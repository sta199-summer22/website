# Data Science

---

## What is Data Science?

--

- Data science is using data to understand the world.

- We're going to learn to do this in a principled and `tidy` way -- more on that later!

- This is a course on introduction to data science, with an emphasis on statistical thinking.

---

## Course FAQ

**Q - What data science background does this course assume?**
A - None.

<br>

**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**
A - Not a traditional one. While statistics $\neq$ data science, they are very closely related and have tremendous of overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics.

<br>

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**
A - Yes. We will use the computing language R.

---

## Course Learning Objectives

- Learn to explore, visualize, and analyze data in a *reproducible* and *shareable* manner.

- Gain experience in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization.

- Develop your own question(s) about data and use statistical techniques to answer the question(s).

- Practice effective oral and written communication of results. 

---

## Some of What You Will Learn

- Fundamentals of `R`

- Version control with `GitHub`

- Reproducible reports with `R Markdown`

- Data visualization and wrangling with `ggplot2` and `dplyr` from the `tidyverse`

<!-- - Web based applications with `RShiny` -->
