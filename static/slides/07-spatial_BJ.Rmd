## Today's Goal 

- Understand spatial data frame structure
- Be able to create a visualization from a spatial data frame

---

## Spatial Data are Interesting and Important! 

- Straightforward visualization through maps
- Help detecting spatial trends 
- Many real examples have spatial patterns 
    - air pollutants 
    - water pollutants 
    - disease spread 
    - home sales prices
    - $\cdots$
- Analyses of such data should account for their spatial relationships 

---

## Quiz

**Q - Which package are we going to use in this class to work with spatial data?**

--

`library(sf)`

- represents "simple features" as records in a `data.frame` or `tibble` with a **geometry** column
  - simple features can contain both spatial and non-spatial data
- compatible with `dplyr` functions we've learnt
- functions begin with `st_`
--

- how to draw an `sf` object in ggplot?

--
`geom_sf()`

---

## Quiz

**Q - What do you need to check before visualizing and wrangling multiple `sf` objects?**

--

Coordinate reference system (CRS) - they should match

---

class: middle, center
