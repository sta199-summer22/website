## Today's Goal 

- Understand population, sample, event, sample space, and probability.
- Compute probabilities of events from data
- Create a contingency table using `pivot_wider()` and `kable()`
- Use a contingency table to explore the relationship between two categorical variables.

---

## Quiz 

One goal of statistics is to answer a research question, 
by making inferences about a population based on data in one or more samples.

--

**Q - What is a research question?**

--

What we want to learn and what we are curious about. For example:  

  - How likely is it for patients with early Parkinson's disease to experience a serious movement disorder within 5 years after the first diagnosis? 
  - Does the average amount of caffeine vary by vendor in 12 oz. cups of coffee at Duke coffee shops?
  - How popular is the president among college students? 

---

## Quiz 

**Q - What is a "population"?**

--

- Entire group we are interested in studying 
- **Parameter**: a numerical quantity derived from the population (almost always unknown)
- If we had data from every unit in the population, we could just calculate population parameters and be done!

--

**Q - What is a "sample"?**

--

- The group we have collected data from (a subset of our population of interest)
- **Statistic**: a numerical quantity derived from a sample 
- Usually we have to settle with a sample and draw conclusions from it because the population is just too big! 

---

## Quiz 

**Q - What is a good sample and why is it important?**

--

- A sample that represents the target population well (has similar characteristics as the population) is a good sample
- Representativeness is what makes the conclusions and inferences from the sample generalizable and valid to the whole population
- Similar to tasting a spoonful of soup while cooking to make an inference about the entire pot 

---

## Quiz 

**Q - Identify the population and potential samples to answer the following questions.**

How likely is it for patients with early Parkinson's disease to experience a serious movement disorder within 5 years after the first diagnosis? 
  
--

- population: all patients with early Parkinson's disease
- sample: patients with early Parkinson's disease who agree to be followed up from Duke Hospital

---

## Quiz 

**Q - Identify the population and potential samples to answer the following questions.**

Does the average amount of caffeine vary by vendor in 12 oz. cups of coffee at Duke coffee shops?

--

- population: all 12 oz. cups of coffee at Duke coffee shops
- sample: randomly selected 50 cups of coffee (12 oz.) by each vendor at Duke coffee shops

---

## Quiz 

**Q - Identify the population and potential samples to answer the following questions.**

How popular is the president among college students? 
 
--

- population: all college students
- sample: randomly selected college students who share their opinions about the president 

---

## Quiz 

In order to draw principled conclusions from data, we rely on a formal **probabilistic framework** that allows us to quantify uncertainty.

**Q - In probability theory, what is a term indicating the result of an observation or experiment?**

--

- "Event"
- Usually denoted by capital letters 
- $A$ is the event that a student in STA199 is a sophomore. 
- $A^c$ ("$A$ complement") is the event that $A$ is not true; a student in STA199 is not a sophomore. 

---

## Quiz 

**Q - What is a "sample space"?**

--

- Set of all possible outcomes 
- {Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior}
- $\Omega = A \cup A^c$
- Varies by research questions 

---

## Quiz 

**Q - Say in words the following math expressions.**

$A$ is the event that a student in STA199 is a sophomore. 
$B$ is the event that a student in STA199 is a senior. 

- Union: $A \cup B$

--

- Intersection: $A \cap B$

--

  - Is it possible? If not, we say $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive or disjoint.

--

- Complement: $B^c$

---


## Quiz 

**Q - What is the "probability" of an event?**

--

- How likely an event is to occur
- Interpretations (1) vs. (2)

  - (1) The proportion of times the event would occur if it could be observed an infinite number of times. 
  - (2) Degree of belief an event will happen

---

## Quiz 

**Q - Probability Rules?**

--

- [0, 1]

--

- The probability of the entire sample space is 1; $P(\Omega) = 1$

--

- Complement rule: $P(A) + P(A^c) = 1$

--

- Additive rule: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$

  - Avoiding double-counting 
  - If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, $P(A \cap B)=0$ and thus $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$

```{r gunter, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align="center"}

```

For 64,821 men enrolled in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition after a mean follow-up of 16.4 years

```{r, echo = F}
coffee <- c(rep("Does not drink coffee", 6477), 
            rep("Drinks coffee occasionally", 29809), 
            rep("Drinks coffee regularly", 28535))
died <- c(rep("Died", 1039), rep("Did not die", 5438), 
          rep("Died", 4440), rep("Did not die", 25369),
          rep("Died", 3601), rep("Did not die", 24934))

## Let's Practice Together! 

Let $A$ be the event that a man died and $B$ be the event that a man was a non-coffee drinker. 
Calculate the following probabilities for a randomly selected person in the cohort:

.midi[
```{r, echo = F}
coffee <- c(rep("Does not drink coffee", 6477), 
            rep("Drinks coffee occasionally", 29809), 
            rep("Drinks coffee regularly", 28535))
died <- c(rep("Died", 1039), rep("Did not die", 5438), 
          rep("Died", 4440), rep("Did not die", 25369),
          rep("Died", 3601), rep("Did not die", 24934))
knitr::kable(table(coffee, died))
```
]

- $P(A)$

--
= 9080/64821
--

- $P(B)$

--
= 6477/64821
--

- $P(A \cap B)$

--
= 1039/64821
--

- $P(A \cup B)$

--
= (9080 + 6477 - 1039)/64821
--

- $P(A \cup B^c)$

--
= (9080 + 58344 - 8041)/64821
