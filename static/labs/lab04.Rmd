## Goals

- Practice collaboration using the data science workflow
- Develop effective spatial visualizations to answer research questions

# Getting started

[Check the spreadsheet](https://duke.box.com/s/qlx0x1vvxmevxvk2gxaok38yg3u2jp84) to find your team number and members.

Before getting started on the lab, take a few minutes to develop a plan for 
working as a team for the rest of the semester.

- Introduce yourself.
- Find a one hour block of time outside of class that you can use to work on the lab / project if needed. You may not need to use this, but it is good to have it in reserve. Tools like [Doodle](https://doodle.com/en/)
and [When2Meet](https://www.when2meet.com/) are helpful.
- Determine how your group will communicate (email, text, slack, discord, etc).

Every team member should now go to the course GitHub organization and locate your lab04 repository, which should have the prefix **lab04**. Copy the URL of the repository and clone in RStudio. If you have trouble, see the first lab and lecture for step-by-step instructions or ask a teammate for help.

You all will work in the same `.Rmd` document and submit one pdf to gradescope.

**Do not edit the `.Rmd` file until explicitly asked to do so in the instructions.**

# 2020 Census and Reapportionment

In this lab you will use the `sf` package to visualize data related to the 2020 census and the reapportionment process.

The variables in the `census` file are as follows:

- `state`: The state abbreviation.
- `pop_2020`: The population of the state in 2020. 
- `pop_2010`: The population of the state in 2010.
- `seats_2020`: The number of seats apportioned to the state in 2020.
- `seats_2010`: The number of seats apportioned to the state in 2010.
- `seats_1910`: The number of seats apportioned to the state in 1910.

There are a series of variables in the `nc_dists` data set, but the most important are follows:

- `STUSPS `: The state abbreviation.
- `geometry`: `sf` geometry

The Census data comes from the [US Census](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/dec/2020-apportionment-data.html).

The shapefile and other spatial analysis files also come from the [US Census](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html).

Exercise 1. Before getting started, write a group contract on how you will work together as a team this semester...

# Team workflow

Assign each team member a number 1 through 3 (or 4) and write your number down on a piece of paper. This lab will walk you through the basics of team workflow step-by-step.

**Do the following exercises in order, following each step carefully.**

**Only one person at a time should type in the `.Rmd` file and push updates.**

**If you are working on any portion of the lab virtually, one person may code and share their screen and the others should follow along.**

<span style="color: red;">**Team member 1:**</span> Open the `lab04-template.Rmd` file 
and change the author of the YAML header to the following "Team Number:
Member 1, Member 2, Member 3" with your team number (for example 05-1) and the
first and last names of all team members.

<span style="color: red;">**Team member 1:**</span> Run the `load-data` code 
chunk to read in the data and print the first six rows. Share the results with 
your team members. Then, answer the questions below.

2. Join the `states` and `census` data sets to form a dataset called `census_data`. Then, for simplicity in this lab, filter out Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.

<span style="color: red;">**Team member 1:**</span> When you have finished,
knit to PDF, then stage, commit, and push your `.Rmd` and PDF to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

<span style="color: red;">**All other team members:**</span> Once your team 
member has pushed the work, pull to get the updated documents from GitHub. Click on the `.Rmd` file and you should see the responses to the second exercise. Run the code chunks for #2 to update the file in your environment.

<span style="color: red;">**Team member 2:**</span> It's your turn. Answer the questions below.

3. Modify the `us-plot-1` code chunk to create a plot of the 2020 Census population data by state. Give the plot an informative title, subtitle, and legend title. When you are finished, remove `eval = FALSE`.

<span style="color: red;">**Team member 2:**</span> Knit to PDF, then stage, commit, and push your `.Rmd` and PDF to GitHub with an appropriate commit 
message.

<span style="color: red;">**All other team members:**</span> Once your team 
member has pushed the work, pull to get the updated documents from GitHub. Click on the `.Rmd` file and you should see the responses to the first three exercises.
Run the code chunks for #2 and #3 to update the file in your environment. 

<span style="color: red;">**Team member 3:**</span> It's your turn. Complete the exercises below. (If you have four team members, you could have person 3 do #4 and person 4 do #5. The main point is to make sure everyone is contributing!)

4. Create a new variable using `mutate()` in the `ex-4` code chunk. 

Overwrite the `census_data` data set to add a  variable that measures the *change* in population from 2020 in 2016 called `pop_change`. This variable should represent the *percentage* change in population in 2020 compared to 2010. When you are finished, remove `eval = FALSE`.

5. Modify the `us-plot-2` code chunk to create a plot of the population percentage *change* from 2010 to 2020, with districts colored according to `pop_change`. Use informative colors with the `scale_fill_gradient2` function.  Set a midpoint at 0% population change. When making the scale, use informative colors, and set a midpoint at 0 (thus representing **no change** from 2010 to 2020.) When you are finished, remove `eval = FALSE`. Please describe what you observe. What regional patterns are present? Did some states lose population?

<span style="color: red;">**Team member 3:**</span> Knit to PDF, then stage,
commit, and push your `.Rmd` and PDF to GitHub with an appropriate commit
message.

<span style="color: red;">**All other team members:**</span> Once your team 
member has pushed the work, pull to get the updated documents from GitHub. Click on the `.Rmd` file and you should see the responses to the first five exercises. Run the code chunks for #1 - #4 to update the file in your environment.

<span style="color: red;">**Team member 1:**</span> It's your turn. Complete the exercise below. 

6. Now, we are going to compare the change in **seats** apportioned to each state from 2010 to 2020. First, create a new variable called `seat_change_2010` that measures the increase in seats apportioned to a state in 2010 compared to 2010 (a negative value would indicate seats lost).

- Modify the `us-plot-3` code chunk to create a plot of the seat change from 2010 to 2020, with districts colored according to `seat_change_2010`. When making the scale, use informative colors, and set a midpoint at 0 (thus representing **no change** in the number of seats apportioned in each Census. When you are finished, remove `eval = FALSE`.

- Finally, describe what patterns you observe in terms of which states gained and lost seats.

<span style="color: red;">**Team member 1:**</span> Knit to PDF, then stage, 
commit, and push your `.Rmd` and PDF to GitHub with an appropriate commit 
message.

<span style="color: red;">**All other team members:**</span> Once your team 
member has pushed the work, pull to get the updated documents from GitHub. Click  on the `.Rmd` file and you should see the responses to the first five  exercises. Run the code chunks for #1 - #4 to update the file in your environment. 

<span style="color: red;">**Team member 2:**</span> Almost done! Just one more question...

7. Finally, we are going to compare the change in **seats** apportioned to each state from *1910* to 2020. First, I would like you to create a new variable called `seat_change_1910` that measures the increase in seats apportioned to a state in 2020 compared to 1910 (a negative value would indicate seats lost over this 110 year period).

- Modify the `us-plot-4` code chunk to create a plot of the seat change from 1910 to 2020, with districts colored according to `seat_change_1910`. When making the scale, use informative colors, e.g.
```
scale_fill_gradient2(low = "#0015BC", high = "#DE0100")
```
and set a midpoint at 0, using additional argument `midpoint=0`, (thus representing **no change** in the number of seats apportioned in each Census. When you are finished, remove `eval = FALSE`.

- Finally, describe what patterns you observe in terms of which states gained and lost seats over this 110 year period.

<span style="color: red;">**Team member 2:**</span>  Check to confirm all code chunks are named, code does not exceed the 80 character limit and all code
follows the tidyverse style guidelines. Make changes as necessary.

<span style="color: red;">**Team member 2:**</span> When you have finished,
knit to PDF, then stage, commit, and push your `.Rmd` and PDF to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

<span style="color: red;">**All other team members:**</span> Once your team 
member has pushed the work, pull to get the updated documents from GitHub. Click on the `.Rmd` file to see your final version of the lab. 

<span style="color: red;">**Team member 3:**</span> Upload your team's PDF to Gradescope. **Include every team member's name in the Gradescope submission and identify which problems are on each page in Gradescope.** Associate the "Overall" section with the first page of your PDF.

There should only be **one submission per team** on Gradescope.
