## Goals

-   Gain proficiency in data visualization and data-wrangling functions
-   Apply principles of effective data visualization to a real dataset
-   Answer real research questions using related datasets
-   Practice data science workflow using git and GitHub

## Getting started

- Go to [course GitHub organization page](https://github.com/sta199-summer22) and find the repository entitled "hw01-GitHubUsername"
- Clone the repo and make a new project in RStudio. 
- Find `hw01.Rmd` to open the template R Markdown file. 

## Formatting 

- All plots should follow best visualization practices; plots should include:

  - an informative title, 
  - axes that are labeled, and 
  - careful consideration should be given to aesthetic choices.
  - Please choose colorblind-friendly color maps such as `viridis`, `scico`, and many others.

- Place all plots in the center and properly adjust their size so that they are placed nicely in a written report. 

- Don’t forget to label your R chunk as well. Your label should be short, informative, shouldn’t include spaces, and shouldn’t repeat a previous label.

## Hawaii Airbnb Listings in 2021

The following data were originally distributed by [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data) (date compiled: 11 Dec, 2021) and has been modified for the purpose of this homework.

We will work on two datasets, namely, `hawaii` and `hawaii_nb`. The dataset `hawaii` contains summary information and metrics for listings in Hawaii for the following variables: 

- `id`: ID number of the listing
- `host_id`: ID number for the host 
- `neighbourhood`: Neighbourhood the listing is located in
- `neighbourhood_group`: Neighbourhood group (major islands) the listing is located in
- `room_type`: Room type of the listing 
- `price`: Daily price in US dollar 
- `minimum_nights`: Minimum number of night stay for the listing
- `number of reviews`: Number of reviews the listing has in the last 12 months
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
- `review_scores_rating`: Average rating of the listing 

An `sf` object `hawaii_nb`contains geometry information on neighborhoods of Hawaii. 

**Note**: You do not have to worry about the last line in the code chunk below; 
it simply replaces column names with better understandable ones for future use. 

```{r load-data, message = FALSE}
hawaii <- read_csv("data/hawaii_airbnb.csv")
hawaii_nb <- st_read("data/hawaii_airbnb_neighborhood.shp", quiet = TRUE)
names(hawaii_nb)[1:2] <- c("neighbourhood", "neighbourhood_group")
```

1. How many observations (rows) does the dataset `hawaii` have? What does each row in the dataset represent? How many variables (columns) does `hawaii` have? Identify `review_scores_rating` and `room_type` as numeric continuous, numeric discrete, categorical ordinal, or categorical nominal.

2. Reproduce the following tables. The column "count" represents the number of listings, and "percentage" is the associated percentage. Hint: 

    - Include `knitr::kable(., digits = 3)` at the end of your pipeline to neatly display tables in your final document with numbers rounded to three decimal places. 
    - You may create a new variable using `ifelse()` for the column "minimum stay < 30?". 
    - When your variable name has space in between, you need quotation marks. 

```{r hw1-ex2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '75%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hw1_ex2_tab1.png")
knitr::include_graphics("img/hw1_ex2_tab2.png")
knitr::include_graphics("img/hw1_ex2_tab3.png")
```

3. Create a faceted histogram where each facet represents a neighborhood and displays the distribution of Airbnb prices in that neighborhood. In order to better understand the neighborhoods, fill histograms for neighborhoods in the same group (`neighbourhood_group`) in the same color. How would you describe the distribution of price in general? How do neighborhoods compare to each other in terms of price? 

    - Think critically about whether it makes more sense to stack the facets on top of each other in a column, lay them out in a row, or wrap them around. Along with your visualization, include your reasoning for the layout you chose for your facets. 
    - You should decide what makes a reasonable bin width for the histogram by trying out a few options.
    - You should decide if scales should be fixed or not. If the scales are fixed, every facet is drawn on the same ranges of x values and y values. 
    - Make sure your figure is large enough to properly display histograms for all facets. 

4. We will examine median listing prices of neighborhoods. 
    - Create a summary dataset called `hawaii_summary` with the minimum, mean, median, standard deviation, IQR, and maximum listing price in each neighborhood and identify neighborhoods with the top five median listing prices.
    - Create a new `sf` object `hawaii_sf` that includes all rows and columns from `hawaii_summary` and the associated geometry information from `hawaii_nb`. 
    - Create a map of Hawaii where each neighborhood is colored by the level of its median listing price using `scale_fill_gradient`. Describe what you observe. 

::: {.commit}
`r emo::ji("yarn")` `r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` `r emo::ji("arrow_up")` Knit, commit, and push your final changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.

5. Now you will meet the Airbnb hosts in Hawaii. 
    - How many hosts are there in Hawaii? 
    - Using one pipeline: 
      - create a new variable `annual_revenue` that estimates the annual revenue for the listing in the last 12 months. You may assume that visitors always left a review and stayed in the listing for minimum nights only. Hint: use `minimum_nights`, `price` and `number_of_reviews`. 
      - calculate the sum of the estimated annual revenue and the number of listings by each of the hosts identified by `host_id`.
      - create a scatterplot illustrating the two variables' relationship. Put the number of listings on x-axis. Use `geom_smooth()` for a fitted line. 
    - Interpret your visualization.
    - Are there any outliers? If so, identify them. 

::: {.commit}
`r emo::ji("yarn")` `r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` `r emo::ji("arrow_up")` Knit, commit, and push your final changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.

6. Come up with a question you want to answer using these data, and write it down. Then, answer it using summary statistic(s) and/or visualization(s). 

::: {.commit}
`r emo::ji("yarn")` `r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` `r emo::ji("arrow_up")` Knit, commit, and push your final changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.
